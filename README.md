Our mysh implemented the directory wildcards and the home directory extensions from section 3 of the requirements. For our testing strategy, we created the data.txt and batch.txt files, along with the testcommands plain file. We then implemented the commands in batch.txt and testcommands file in the terminal to create the newdata.txt and sort.txt files.
